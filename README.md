# Letter frequency

This repository contains a Python program that evaluates the letter frequency for the English language. In this example, we use a file named "intro.txt" which contains an introduction chapter from one of the Ph.D. thesis. We are interested in processing this file and extracting all the English language characters and evaluating its frequency.

The file, into.txt is the LaTex equivalent obtained from Ph.D. thesis which is available at http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/158500488?q&versionId=211642740
